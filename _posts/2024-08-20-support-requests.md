Today I felt not great. In the early morning, getting ready for the work, I got a message saying that there is a high priority issue in our website. Someone in the business team also writes a message stressing its importance by tagging me. It stressed me out. I was in a state of hurry while cycling to the office.

While working on the support request in the office, I was anxious. When I get anxious, I think in an unorganised way. The depth of my thoughts became shallow but enormously wide. I find myself getting lost time to time and force myself to come to the original problem. I tend to react rather than act. I noticed that I didn’t drink any water, my posture is tense and incorrect. I caught myself frequently checking Slack if something else is asked from me.

I figured out the problem and supported the business team. The stress level diminished but then I felt a wave of sadness. Maybe it was there all this time, but I wasn’t aware of it. It took half an hour to regulate it.
