Now I'm transitioning to Github Pages from Wordpress. Looking forward to not receiving tons of emails.

I have been a member of WordPress since October 2021. It is almost 3 years now. I don't like WordPress. Here are the reasons:
- Lack of simple templates. I tried multiple times to change my template to something simpler. However I couldn't manage to find a good one. At the end I made a custom one with a black background which turned out not to be a great one.
- Writing on mobile is extremely slow. UX is 1/10.
- Writing on laptop is not fast either. I remember writing my posts on Apple Notes and transferring them back to WordPress.
- Too much emails. I hate you because of this. I don't want to keep my domain as well since you'll always find a chance to send an email. I tried multiple times to unsubscribe from your emails, but found myself to be unsubscribed from one of your email lists. Let's not see each other for some time.

I'm wondering what my experience will be on Github Pages.
